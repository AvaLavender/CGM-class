    <p>Web development is the process of building, creating, and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves
    technical skills like coding and database management, as well as creative problem-solving to create user-friendly
    digital experiences. Key components include front-end development (what the user sees) and back-end development (the
    behind-the-scenes server, database, and application logic).</p>
    <div id="test">Key aspects of web development;
    Front-end development: Focuses on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), or what the user sees and interacts
    with directly in their browser.
    Back-end development: Handles the server-side logic, databases, and application programming that are not visible to the
    user but are essential for the site to function correctly.
    Full-stack development: A combination of both front-end and back-end development.</div>
