                <h3>What are cats</h3>
                <p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It
                is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
                domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and working cat, but it
                also ranges freely as a feral cat, avoiding human contact.</p>

                <p>Cat communication includes meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, grunting, and body language. It can hear
                sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives
                pheromones. Cat intelligence is evident in its ability to adapt, learn through observation, and solve problems.</p>
