        February 14.[2] It originated as a Christian feast day honoring a martyr named Valentine, and through later folk
        traditions it has also become a significant cultural, religious and commercial celebration of romance, commitment, and

        <P> <small style="color: brown;">There are a number of martyrdom stories associated with various Saint Valentines connected to February 14,[6] including
        an account of the imprisonment of Saint Valentine of Rome for ministering to Christians persecuted under the Roman
        Empire in the third century.[7][8] According to an early tradition, Saint Valentine restored sight to the blind daughter
        of his jailer.[9] Numerous later additions to the legend have better related it to the theme of love: tradition
        maintains that Saint Valentine performed weddings for Christian soldiers who were forbidden to marry by the Roman
        emperor;[8] an 18th-century embellishment to the legend claims he wrote the jailer's daughter a letter signed <mark class="Dnager">"Your
        Valentine"</mark> as a farewell before his execution.[10] or the Feast of Saint Valentine,[1] is celebrated annually on
        February 14.[2]</small></P>
